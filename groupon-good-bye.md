title: Good Bye, Groupon
salutation: My fellow Grouponeers, dearest I-Tiers,
---

As I descend one last time into these our coupon mines,
I am reminded of an old folk song my parents used to sing to me:

> Good bye, old coupon mine<br/>
> it's been a whole lot of fun.<br/>
> But now I'm off to see the world<br/>
> while I'm still young.
>

When I first set foot in these hollowed halls<sup>1</sup>,
the year was 2011, the contract work temporary,
and the Club Mate plentiful.
Looking back at those past eight years,
I want to extend some words of appreciation to Grouponites past and present.
In mostly chronological order:

**Leo Wehmeier** for telling me about that freelance gig at Groupon<br/>
**Marcus Pappert** for giving said gig to me<br/>
**Ronny Ahlswede** for hiring me full-time<br/>
**Daniel Schroeder** for the time with the PHP department in online marketing<br/>
**The Groupon shop team**
for lunches at the pub and teaching me what working in a product team means<br/>
**Philipp Staender** for forcing me to learn node.js<br/>
**Tobias Janiesch and Stephan Betz** for sending me across the globe to learn about the US platform<br/>
**Bojan Babic** for always ending up where I am for some reason..?<br/>
**Greg Conklin** for making me excited about Groupon's new front-end architecture<br/>
**Daniel Schröder and Andreas Richter** for explaining front-end development to me
and having patience when I wanted to sneak things into a release yet again<br/>
**Richie Voss and Kyle Oppenheim** for making me appreciate how difficult it is to merge two e-commerce systems<br/>
**The I-Tier team** (Sean McCullough, Sean Massa, Todd Larsen, Kyle Blomquist)
for accepting my unsolicited PRs from across the ocean<br/>
**Tristan Blease** for being the northstar over the years for the kind of software engineer I wanted to be<br/>
**Adam Geitgey** for poaching me for his team,
being the greatest manager I could have ever hoped for,
and every single bad photoshop posted to our team room<br/>
**Aileen Sandridge** for showing me that Adam wasn't all that special after all<br/>
**Brian McCallister and Henning Schmiedehausen** for sitting next to me
and opening my eyes to a whole new world beyond node.js<br/>
**David Bushong** for demonstrating the great things that can happen
when working with somebody who has no patience for bad tools<br/>
**Every other member of the core I-Tier team and on the various front-end product teams at Groupon**
for having patience whenever I broke everything
and for allowing me to gain your trust over the years<br/>
**Varun Sood and Eric Farraro** for always striving the strike the perfect balance
between shipping features quickly and great craft.<br/>
**AJ** for standing tall as example of self-reflection and humility<br/>
**The principals group**
for countless insights, advice, and opportunities to sharpen my judgement<br/>
**Groupon engineers**
for being kind, genuine, fun-loving, and invested in each other's success<br/>

I'm excited to see what y'all do next
so let's not dwell on the past.
The state of the coupon is strong.
May Fortuna bless you and may she bless the united channels of Groupon.

Cheers,<br/>
Jan

P.S.: My idea for a [Groupon musical ad][musical-ad] is still up for grabs.

P.P.S.: Grouponeers? Grouponites? Groupanions? Did we ever settle on a term?

<sup>1</sup> No, this is not a typo. Hollow(ed). Mines. I'm terrible at puns. I'll stop now.
