## Skills

Passing familiarity with various stacks and technologies,
fairly exceptional understanding of **JavaScript** in particular.
Dusty knowledge of **computer graphics** where I spent most of my early life,
slightly more recent exposure to **web technologies**.

More importantly a knack for taking in the opinions, experiences, and motivations
from various people and distilling them down to something everyone can agree on.
And then explaining the result to others in a way that they can relate to.
